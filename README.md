### What is this repository?
This repository is for creating a JAR file to populate HBASE tables with enterprises with one or more legal units (as oppososed to the single legal unit in sbr-enterprise-assemble). The jar is uploaded to HDFS to be run via a spark2-submit command on an edgenode terminal.

### Prerequisites

* Java 8 or higher
* SBT ([Download](http://www.scala-sbt.org/))

### Development Setup (MacOS)

To install SBT quickly you can use Homebrew ([Brew](http://brew.sh)):
```shell
brew install sbt
```
Similarly we can get Scala (for development purposes) using brew:
```shell
brew install scala
```
Install HBase locally with brew by using:
```shell
brew install hbase
```

### Running the App

By default, the app will run locally. To run it in cluster mode, you must pass in the 10th paramater as "cluster"

##### HBase

HBase can be started locally by:
```shell
start-hbase.sh
```

Now that HBase has started, we can open the shell and create the namespace and tables.
```sbtshell
hbase shell
create_namespace 'ons'
create 'ons:ENTERPRISE', 'd'
create 'ons:LINKS', 'l'
```

To compile, build and run the application use the following command:
```shell
sbt run
```

The application should have built, created some Hfiles and used them to populate the HBase table. The Hfiles should be located at src/main/resources and should be directories titled enterprises and links.

You can then query the HBase tables to see if they populated correctly, using these commands in the HBase shell:
```sbtshell
scan "ons:LINKS", {LIMIT => 200}
scan "ons:ENTERPRISE", {LIMIT => 200}
```
